# SecuriTree-Frontend
The react js frontend for SecuriTree App.
This front end application is the presentational layer for the SecuriTree application system.
It authenticates and fetches the data from the backend API, displays the Securitree Areas in a hierarchy, allows locking and unlocking of doors and automatic uploading of data.
This frontend makes it easy for a user to manage the SecuriTree entities: doors and areas. A user can update the hierarchy and the entity details by uploading a new JSON file into the system data field. They can easily search for a door, see it's status and update the status as either closed or open.
